### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jonah, and I am a graduate of BSc Maths and Physics from the University of St. Andrews, and of MSc Weather and Climate Science from the University of Exeter. Through my time at university I learned to code using Python, R, and briefly Wolfram Mathematica. For my postgraduate dissertation I heavily utilised python scripts to run atmospheric simulations and analyse the data. I have used R and Python scripts to complete assignments throughout my academic career, ranging from complex atmospheric simulations, to modelling numerical methods for solving mathematical equations, and to analysing large datasets.

I am looking for a full-time oppertunity to develop and apply my coding skills. Please reach out to me!
